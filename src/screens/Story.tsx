			<h1>Hanging By A Moment</h1>
			<h2>How We Met</h2>
			<h3>Written by Allison (obviously)</h3>
			<p>
				Chris and Allison met during their freshman year of high school working
				on a group project together. Before that project, they had never really
				interacted and were very much opposites: she was very hyper and outgoing
				while he preferred to fly under the radar and not attract any attention
				whatsoever. Allison and her friends were very much nerdy (and dorky),
				while Chris and his friends were brooding and lamenting their high
				school existence. Needless to say, it was definitely not love at first
				sight for either of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				While they were working on a group project for their theology class,
				Allison kept asking him who he liked to an annoying degree, and he
				didn’t really budge. It was then that she realized that though she knew
				a lot about most people in their class (a class of about 35 other
				freshmen), she didn’t know much about him. Chris quickly became a man of
				mystery and intrigue, and Allison was into it. By the end of the school
				year, she had developed an unreasonably huge crush on Chris...but he
				wasn’t interested. #UnrequitedLove
			</p>
			<p>
				About two years, a few different love interests, and many AIM and
				MySpace conversations later, Allison and Chris finally started dating
				during their junior year. As they got to know each other and grow, they
				had many talks about the future and what they thought it would entail:
				college, moving in, marriage, etc. The pair agreed on most things, in
				particular that marriage would happen after college because of how young
				they were.
			</p>
			<p>
				Together, they went to community college. Then they transferred to Cal
				State LA and got their bachelor degrees…followed by Chris starting a
				business while Allison worked on her master’s degree. Chris then started
				studying computer programming...and after 11 years of dating (yes,
				ELEVEN), Allison realized they weren't 16 anymore and that she had
				finished college which made her realize she wanted them to take the next
				step in their relationship…but Chris would say, “Why so soon?” Needless
				to say, Allison was unamused.
			</p>
			<p>
				As her frustration started growing, little did she know that Chris had
				been planning something for the both of them.
			</p>
			<h2>How He Asked</h2>
			<p>
				In December 2018, Chris and Allison decided to take their first
				international trip together. They originally planned a trip to Paris,
				Rome, Venice, and Florence (which was awesome!), but Chris ended up
				surprising her by changing their trip to include stops only in Germany,
				Venice, and Rome. Chris, who is really great at surprises, knew that
				visiting Allison’s high school friend, Delia, was important to her
				because when she was fifteen, she had promised Delia back in 2006 that
				she would visit her some day. And now that it was 2018 and they were
				planning this trip, he made it happen for her! Allison was so excited
				and overwhelmed by this surprise that it moved her to tears (which, if
				you know Allison, isn’t too surprising because she is an emotional
				creature). Soon after, Delia FaceTimed (video chatted with) Allison to
				try and plan out things that they could do together.
			</p>
			<p>
				Flash forward to Munich, Germany. Chris and Allison spent the first
				night with Delia and her boyfriend Timo at a Christmas Market where they
				tried gluhwein and gebrannte mandeln (thanks to Allison’s friend, Sara,
				for the suggestion!). Delia and Timo told their friends that they had
				planned out the next two days so that the four of them could spend time
				outside of the city. They planned a trip to Neushwanstein Castle, the
				castle that served as inspiration for Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle, a
				pillar of romance! Following their visit to the castle, the four would
				drive to Austria where Delia's family has a cabin where they would stay
				for the night. At first, Allison thought the plan seemed a little
				strange and out of left field, but she also found the plans spontaneous
				and exciting so she didn’t think much of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				After touring the castle, Timo suggested they take a small hike to get a
				scenic view of the castle from a distance. Delia said it was a beautiful
				view and that Allison and Chris would love it, so they agreed to go
				check it out. Little did Allison know that Chris was planning to
				propose!
			</p>
			<p>
				After they exited the gift shop, Timo and Delia asked a gift shop
				employee about the entrance of the hiking trail only to find out that it
				was closed because of heavy snowfall. Not knowing what had been planned,
				Allison shrugged it off (because she obviously didn’t know what was
				going on), and Chris, nervous as he already was, felt panicky because
				his plan was shot. Timo and Delia reassured him not to worry because
				everything would work out...and his trust in them would pay off.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next day, the four friends woke up to a beautiful morning in
				Salzburg. Delia informed Allison that the plan for the day was to go on
				a sleigh ride followed by a hike to a beautiful restaurant in the hills
				followed by riding sleds back down the hills to go back to the cabin. In
				other words, they had all planned the perfect winter day.
			</p>
			<p>
				While waiting outside of their cabin, the sound of jingle bells – real,
				honest-to-god, melodious bells – floating towards them from around the
				corner of a cluster of pine trees. From behind the trees emerged a
				beautiful, horse-drawn sleigh in full Christmas effect. It was straight
				out of a fairytale. Oh, and the sleigh driver? His name was Hans. Could
				it have been any more perfect?
			</p>
			<p>
				Hans drove the quartet all around the small town telling them about his
				horses, his family’s farm in Hinterthal, and showing them the gorgeous
				parts of the small village that they were fortunate to be visiting.
				Every moment of the sleigh ride took them further and further away from
				city life and deeper into fairytale life: pine trees covered in soft,
				delicate snow; historic churches covered in icicles; miles of mountains
				perfect for skiing and singing Julie Andrews-inspired songs; and light
				snowfall melting on our beanies as we breathed in the icy, Christmas
				air. Some people were walking in the snow, smiling and waving to the
				four as if they had known them their whole lives. All in all, the four
				took in and embraced the holiday spirit in these moments on the sleigh.
				It was perfection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before they knew it, Hans stopped driving and told Allison, Chris,
				Delia, and Timo to climb out of the sleigh so that they could see the
				water curtain of Maria Alm.
			</p>
			<p>
				Water curtain? Allison was skeptical of this translation. According to
				Timo and Delia, it wasn’t quite a waterfall, and it wasn’t quite frozen,
				and the water curtain was unique to the area.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chris and Allison thought it sounded intriguing, so they went along with
				it and decided to walk a little ways from the sleigh to see this water
				curtain. As they got closer, the water curtain was clearly an oxymoron
				of nature – both frozen and not, somehow still and in motion. As
				freezing as it was outside, water dripped down, leaving icicles in its
				wake, a shallow pool of water underneath it. A one-of-a-kind sight to
				behold. It was beautiful and the location secluded from other tourists
				and people in general...the kind of place perfect for a proposal. The
				thought flickered for a moment through Allison’s mind, and she tried not
				to get her hopes up, but the day had been going so perfect that it was
				hard NOT to get excited.
			</p>
			<p>
				Allison noticed that Timo had stopped to chat with Hans, and he was
				trying to quickly catch up to the pair. Meanwhile, Delia suggested that
				Chris and Allison take a picture together in front of the water curtain,
				to which Allison suspiciously agreed.
			</p>
			<p>
				She felt my heart racing as they walked together to the water curtain.
				They both took a moment to look at it together, and it was both a
				beautiful and agonizing moment. They looked at each other, and Allison
				smiled at Chris.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chris looked at Allison, his gaze lingering in a way she was unfamiliar
				with. She couldn’t read his expression. It is hard to imagine how
				nervous he must have been as he tried to nonchalantly take something out
				of his pocket. While keeping his eyes on Allison, he said, “Are you
				ready?”
			</p>
			<p>
				HEARTS DEFINITELY POUNDING NOW. Allison tried to play it cool, but she
				felt her smile growing bigger and cheesier by the second.
			</p>
			<p>
				She hesitated, “...Ready for what?” Then, he handed her a small, white
				box, and she couldn’t play it cool anymore. “What is this? WHAT IS
				HAPPENING?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He smiled. And before she could open the box, Chris quickly took it back
				from her. They were both so nervous – neither of them really knew what
				they were doing – so we started laughing. She brought her hand to his
				face, something she does when she’s hella nervous, and she just kept
				smiling at him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before Allison knew it, he started to go down on one knee. And very true
				to the goofy nature of their relationship, he almost slipped right into
				the water curtain because he was wearing the wrong type of shoes (and
				this was after Allison gave him a hard time in the morning before they
				left for not packing the right shoes!). She grabbed onto his arm, and he
				opened the box to reveal the most beautiful emerald ring she had ever
				seen.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then Chris asked her the question that she had been waiting eleven years
				and eleven months -- to the day -- to hear:
			</p>
			<p>“Will you marry me?”</p>
			<p>
				And of all the things she imagined herself saying during this most
				important moment of their relationship, nothing prepared her for what
				came out of her mouth.
			</p>
			<p>
				She squeezed his arm tighter, leaned in close to his face, looked deeply
				into his green eyes, and mumbled, “Are you serious? Is all of this real?
				Am I imagining this?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He nervously laughed a little, and said, “No, I’m obviously joking. Of
				course it’s real!” Then they both laughed. She kissed him again and
				again and again in the snow, hanging by the moment as long as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then she finally looked at him again, still holding him, face to face,
				wearing the cheesiest smile of her whole life (and trust – he’s seen
				some pretty terrible cheesy smiles on her face), and she finally
				whispered as excitedly and lovingly as she could muster, “Yes! Yes, I’ll
				marry you, Chris Conner.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He then slid the ring onto her finger, and Allison got to hold her
				fiance for the first time completely forgetting that Delia and Timo (and
				Hans) were all nearby watching this unfold.
			</p>
			<p>
				Delia and Timo congratulated them, gave them hugs, and undoubtedly, took
				some of the best pictures that Chris and Allison have taken during their
				relationship, which they are both still thankful for. As they walked
				back to Hans and the sleigh, they noticed he was standing there waiting
				to congratulate them with shots and gummy bears.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rest of the sleigh ride left her in shock, and all she could do was
				smile and stare at Chris in disbelief that this had all transpired in
				what felt like a whirlwind of minor seconds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later on in the evening, they explored the village nearby, bought Chris
				some proper snow shoes, and hiked up a steep mountainside that was lit
				with lamp posts reminiscent of Lucy climbing through the wardrobe
				landing in Narnia. The hike was long and arduous for Chris and Allison
				(while Delia and Timo seemingly danced up the mountain with ease), but
				to see the snow-covered mountains at night and the stars in the sky, it
				was hard to be distracted by the cold and altitude. Everything about
				this place was magical.
			</p>
			<p>
				To keep the celebration going, the four climbed to the top of the
				mountain to meet a large, magnificent lodge where they had a wonderful
				dinner celebrating their engagement with their friends. The lodge was
				secluded because the only way up to it was to hike, and they didn’t
				encounter other people along the way. Once they got up there to this
				beautiful, snow-covered lodge, they celebrated with a warm meal, drinks,
				and expressing their gratitude for a beautiful day and a wonderful trip
				together. And to end the night, the only way back down the mountain was
				to ride sleds back to the bottom!
			</p>
			<p>
				Delia and Timo navigated quickly and swiftly down the mountain, while
				Chris and Allison endured a learning curve. She crashed into piles of
				snow numerous times, and he would stop to help her crawl out. To end the
				night, the four drove back to Delia’s family’s cabin, and made snow
				angels under a pine tree outside, followed by a snowball fight.
			</p>
			<p>
				Looking back on this day, it was full of beautiful moments that Allison
				and Chris will cherish for the rest of their lives. Moments that
				encompassed love, friendship, the holiday spirit, and anticipation for
				the unknown. Chris and Allison will always be able to look back on this
				day as one moment in their relationship where they decided to get
				married, but more importantly, they can always look back on this moment
				as a day where love grew stronger.
