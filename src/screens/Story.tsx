				<h1>Hanging By A Moment</h1>
				<h2>Written by Allison (obviously)</h2>
				<h3>How We Met</h3>
				<div className='Pics'>

					<p>
						Chris Conner and Allison Bruins met during their freshman year of
						high school working on a group project together before either of
						them had a preconceived notion of how terrible group projects could
						be. Before that project, they had never interacted with one another
						and were very much opposites: she was very hyper and outgoing, while
						he preferred to fly under the radar and not attract any attention
						whatsoever. Allison and her friends were very much nerdy (and
						dorky), while Chris and his friends were brooding, lamenting their
						high school existence. Needless to say, it was definitely not love
						at first sight for either of them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					While they were working on a group project for their theology class,
					Allison, in a poorly made attempt to pass the time, kept pestering
					Chris about who he liked, and, unsurprisingly, he didn’t budge or
					engage in the conversation in a way that appeased her boredom. It was
					then that she realized that though she had many preconceived notions
					about most of her freshmen peers (a class of about 35 other kids), she
					did not know much about him. It was then that Chris quickly became a
					man of mystery and intrigue, and Allison was not-so-shockingly into
					it. By the end of the school year, she had developed an unreasonably
					huge crush on Chris...but he was neither aware nor interested.{' '}

					<p>
						About two years, a few different love interests, and many AIM and
						MySpace conversations (R.I.P.) later, Allison and Chris started
						dating during their junior year. They got to know each other and
						grow, having many talks about the future and what they thought it
						would entail: college, moving in together, marriage, etc. The pair
						agreed on most things, in particular that marriage would happen
						after college if they were still together.

					<p>
						So they went to community college and transferred to Cal State LA
						where they got their bachelor degrees…followed by Chris starting a
						business while Allison worked on her master’s degree. Then, Chris
						then started studying computer programming...and after 11 years of
						dating (yes, eleven), It hit Allison that they weren't 16 anymore
						and that she had finished college. And she wanted to take the next
						step in their relationship based on the conversations they’ve had
						over the years about their goals. But Chris would say, “Why so
						soon?” whenever the topic was brought up. Needless to say, Allison
						was unamused.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					As her frustration started growing, little did she know that Chris had
					plans ruminating for their future.
				</p>
				<h3>How He Asked</h3>
				<p>
					In December 2018, Chris and Allison decided to take their first
					international trip together. They originally planned a trip to Paris,
					Rome, Venice, and Florence (which was an exhilarating plan!), but
					Chris ended up surprising her by changing their trip to focus on stops
					in Munich, Venice, and Rome. Chris, who is really great at surprises,
					knew that visiting Allison’s high school friend, Delia, was important
					to her because when she was in high school, she had promised Delia
					back in 2006 that she would visit her some day. And now that it was
					2018 and they were planning this trip, he made it happen! Allison was
					so overwhelmed by this surprise that it moved her to tears (which, if
					you know Allison, isn’t too surprising because she is an emotional
					creature). Soon after, Delia FaceTimed (video chatted with) Allison to
					try and plan out things that they could do together.
				</p>
				<div className='Pics'>
					<p>
						Flash forward to Munich, Germany. Chris and Allison spent their
						first night abroad with Delia and her boyfriend Timo at a Christmas
						Market where they tried glühwein and gebrannte mandeln (thanks to
						Allison’s friend, Sara, for the suggestion!). Delia and Timo told
						the pair that they had planned out the next two days so that the
						four of them get the most out of their time together and experience
						some of the beauty of the region. They planned a trip to
						Neushwanstein Castle, the castle that served as inspiration for
						Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle, a pillar of romance and historical
						elegance! Following their visit to the castle, the four would drive
						to Delia's family’s cabin in Austria where they would stay the
						night. At first, Allison thought the plan seemed a little strange
						and out of left field, but she also found the plans spontaneously
						fun, so she didn’t think much of it.
					</p>
					<img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/images/pic4.webp'} alt='Pic 4' />
				</div>
				<p>
					After touring the castle, Timo suggested they take a small hike to
					take in the scenic views of the castle and surrounding area from a
					distance. Delia agreed, saying it was a beautiful sight (and site)
					that Allison and Chris would love. Little did Allison know that Chris
					– with the help of Delia and Timo – was planning to propose!
				</p>
				<p>
					Before exiting the gift shop at the end of the castle tour, Timo and
					Delia asked an employee about the entrance of the hiking trail only to
					find out that it was closed due to heavy snowfall. Not knowing what
					had been planned, Allison shrugged it off, and Chris, nervous as he
					already was, felt a small pit of anxiety forming in his stomach
					because his plan was shot. Privately, Timo and Delia reassured him not
					to worry because everything would work out...and his trust in them
					would pay off.
				</p>
				<div className='Pics'>

					<p>
						The next day, the four friends woke up to a beautiful morning in
						Salzburg. Delia informed the group that the plan for the day was to
						go on a sleigh ride followed by a hike to a beautiful restaurant in
						the hills that would be capped off by riding sleds and retiring to
						the cabin for the evening where they could sip on tea and hot
						chocolate. In other words, they had planned the perfect winter day.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					While waiting outside of their cabin, the sound of jingle bells –
					real, honest-to-god, melodious bells – floated towards them from
					around the corner of a cluster of pine trees. From behind the trees
					emerged a beautiful, horse-drawn sleigh in full Christmas effect. It
					was straight out of a fairytale. Two magnificent horses with sleigh
					bells pulled up with a cozy,red sleigh lined with warm blankets
					accompanied by the cheeriest sleigh driver that ever was. And the
					sleigh driver’s name? Hans. Could it have been any more surreal? It
					felt as if they had stepped out of reality and into the rabbit hole of
					fantasy life – something everyone was more than okay with on this
					winter day.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hans the sleight driver drove the quartet all around the small town
					telling them about his horses, his family’s farm in Hinterthal, and
					showing them the gorgeous parts of the small village that they were
					fortunate to be visiting. Every moment of the sleigh ride took them
					further and further away from city life and deeper into fairytale:
					pine trees covered in soft, delicate snow; historic churches decorated
					in icicles; miles of mountains waiting for skiing and singing Julie
					Andrews-inspired songs; and light snowfall fall on their eyelashes as
					they breathed in the icy, Christmas air. Some people were walking
					through the snow, smiling and waving to the four as if they had been
					neighbors their whole lives. All in all, the four took in and embraced
					the holiday spirit in these moments on the sleigh. It was perfection.
					(Or as Dwight Schrute might put it, perfectenschlag…or perfektor
					einschlag? Don’t get us started on what is real German versus The
					Office’s German.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Before they knew it, Hans stopped driving and told Allison, Chris,
					Delia, and Timo to climb out of the sleigh so that they could see the
					water curtain of Maria Alm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Water curtain? Allison was skeptical of this translation. According to
					Timo and Delia, it wasn’t quite a waterfall, and it wasn’t quite
					frozen, and the water curtain was unique to the area.
				</p>
				<div className='Pics'>
					<p>
						Intrigued and curious, Allison and Chris went along with it, walking
						a little ways from the sleigh to view this natural monument. As they
						got closer, the water curtain was clearly an oxymoron of nature –
						both frozen and not, somehow still and in motion. As freezing as it
						was outside, water dripped down, leaving icicles in its wake, a
						shallow pool of water underneath it. A one-of-a-kind sight to
						behold. It was beautiful and secluded...the kind of place perfect
						for a proposal. The thought flickered for a moment through Allison’s
						mind, and she tried not to get her hopes up, but the day had been
						going so perfect that it was hard NOT to get excited.
					</p>
					<img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/images/pic6.webp'} alt='Pic 6' />
				</div>
				<p>
					Allison noticed that Timo had stopped to chat with Hans, but he was
					trying to quickly catch up to the group without slipping in the snow.
					Meanwhile, Delia casually suggested that Chris and Allison take a
					picture together in front of the water curtain, to which Allison
					suspiciously and curiously agreed.
				</p>
				<p>
					She felt her heart racing as they walked together to the water
					curtain. They both took a moment to look at it together. It was a
					beautiful and agonizing moment. They looked at each other and smiled.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chris looked at Allison, his gaze lingering in a way she was
					unfamiliar with. She couldn’t read his expression. It is hard to
					imagine how nervous he must have been as he tried to nonchalantly take
					something out of his pocket. While keeping his eyes on her, he asked,
					“Are you ready?”
				</p>
				<p>
					Hearts definitely pounding now. Allison tried to play it cool, which,
					if you know her, is not really possible in any capacity. Her smile
					grew bigger and cheesier by the second.
				</p>
				<p>
					She hesitated, “...Ready for what?” Then, Chris handed her a small,
					white box, and she couldn’t contain herself anymore. “What is this?
					What is HAPPENING?”
				</p>
				<p>
					He smirked. And before she could open the box, Chris took it back from
					her as quickly as he had given it to her. They were both so nervous –
					neither of them really knew what they were doing – so they started
					laughing. She brought her hand to his face, something she does only
					when she’s hella nervous, and she just kept smiling at him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before Allison knew it, he started to go down on one knee. And very
					true to the goofy nature of their relationship, he almost slipped
					right into the water curtain because he was wearing the wrong type of
					shoes (after Allison gave him a hard time in the morning before they
					left for not packing the right shoes). She grabbed onto his arm to
					help stabilize him, and he opened the box to reveal the most beautiful
					emerald ring she had ever seen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then Chris asked her the question that she had been waiting eleven
					years and eleven months -- to the day -- to hear:
				</p>
				<p>“Will you marry me?”</p>
				<p>
					And of all the things she imagined herself saying during this most
					important moment of their relationship, nothing prepared her for what
					came out of her mouth.
				</p>
				<p>
					She squeezed his arm tighter, leaned in close to his face, looked
					deeply into his green eyes, and mumbled in a concerned manner, “Are
					you serious? Is all of this real? Am I imagining this?”
				</p>
				<p>
					He laughed a little, and said, “No, I’m obviously joking. Of course
					it’s real.” She laughed and kissed him again and again and again in
					the snow, hanging by the moment as long as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					She looked at him, still holding onto his arm, face to face, wearing
					the sappiest smile of her whole life (and trust – he’s seen some
					pretty cheesy smiles on her face over the years), and she whispered as
					excitedly and lovingly as she could muster, “Yes! Yes, I’ll marry you,
					Chris Conner.”
				</p>
				<p>
					He then slid the ring onto her finger, and Allison helped him up so as
					to avoid him falling into the water curtain with his slippery shoes
					and in that moment, she got to embrace her fiance for the first time.
				</p>

					/>
				</div>

				<p>
					Delia and Timo, who they had briefly forgotten about, congratulated
					them with hugs and some of the grandest pictures that Chris and
					Allison have taken during their relationship. As they walked back to
					Hans and the sleigh, they found him standing there grinning and
					waiting to congratulate them with shots and gummy bears. Prost!
				</p>
				<div className='Pics'>
					<img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/images/pic8.webp'} alt='Pic 8' />
					<p>
						The rest of the sleigh ride left Allison dumbfounded, staring at
						Chris in disbelief that this had transpired in what felt like a
						whirlwind of seconds. The four enjoyed the rest of the sleigh ride
						back to their cabin, talking about the plotting and planning that
						put the proposal into action, living in the moment of an
						unforgettable day.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className='Pics'>
					<p>
						Later that evening, the four friends explored the nearby village,
						bought Chris some proper snow shoes (obviously), and decided to end
						the night by climbing a mountain to enjoy a celebratory dinner. They
						hiked up a steep mountainside path that was lit up with lamp posts
						reminiscent of the one in Narnia. One could easily make the
						assumption that Mr. Tumnus would appear any second from behind any
						given tree as they climbed up and up the mountain.
					</p>

				<div className='Pics'>
					<img
						src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/images/pic10.webp'}
						alt='Pic 10'
					/>
					<p>
						The hike was long and arduous for Chris and Allison (while Delia and
						Timo seemingly danced up the mountain chasing one another and
						laughing), and though the air was thin and the incline challenging,
						the four took many small breaks that allowed them to take in the
						surreal views around them: snow-covered mountains and a nighttime
						sky blanketed in stars. It was hard to be distracted by the cold and
						altitude in a place like this. Everything about it emitting magic
						and wonder.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Once the four reached the mountain top, they were met by a
					magnificent, secluded lodge made special by the fact that the only way
					to it was to complete the trek that the four had managed, and in
					winter evenings such as this one, not many people wanted to make the
					journey. At the snow-covered lodge, they celebrated with a warm meal,
					drinks, and gratitude for a remarkable day, lamenting that the only
					imperfection would be that the day had to eventually end (if you’re
					still reading through this sickly mush, you’re a real one!). And to
					cap off the evening, the only way back down the mountain was to ride
					sleds back to the bottom! Yes, sleds!

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Delia and Timo navigated quickly and swiftly down the mountain,
					appearing to be winter-sports pros, while Chris and Allison went
					through a learning curve and made concerted efforts to not slide off
					the side of the mountain’s path and meet unfortunate death.
					(#NotToday) Allison, using her feet as brakes more often than the
					others, crashed into numerous piles of snow – constantly finding
					herself buried from the waist down, laughing. Chris looked back just
					as frequently, knowing that this was likely to happen, and made stops
					to help her crawl out of the snow. Delia and Timo easily made it to
					the bottom at record speeds in comparison to the other two, but once
					they all reached the bottom, the four glanced back at the mountain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chris was in disbelief that they had managed to climb all the way up
					there in one piece because, had he not done the hike himself, he would
					not have thought it possible. To end the night, the four drove back to
					the cabin, and made snow angels under the pine trees – a first for the
					two Americans – followed by a snowball fight. Allison made it a point
					to state that it was her first and last as Chris laughed, implying
					that it would most certainly not be the last for either of them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking back on this day, it was full of a multitude of dreamlike
					moments that Allison and Chris will cherish for the rest of their
					lives. Moments that encompassed love, friendship, growth, the holiday
					spirit, and anticipation for the unknown. The pair will always be able
					to look back on this day as a moment in their relationship where they
					decided to grow together and lift one another up, committing to a
					lifetime of adventures that they have yet to dream of.
